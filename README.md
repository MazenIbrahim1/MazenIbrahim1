# üí´ About Me:
Hi, I am Mazen Ibrahim<br><br>I recently graduated from Stony Brook University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, specializing in Software Development. I have hands-on experience building full stack applications using Reactjs, Nextjs, Node, Express, MongoDB, Firebase, and more that helped me become well-versed in the Software Development Life-Cycle. I am currently working on more projects to further hone my full stack skills. <br><br>Previosuly, I was a Software Engineering Fellow at Headstarter AI where I worked on 5 AI projects,  focused on interview preparation, and networked with other fellows and CEOs from startups like Ruby and Lunchbox. Weekly calls with these CEOs provided valuable insights and motivation for becoming a better Software Engineer.<br><br>In addition to my technical background, I have held leadership position roles as Treasurer and Secretary of the Volleyball Club, where I managed budgets and organized events. At Wendy's, I served as a Team Trainer, leading crew members to deliver highest level of customer service. <br>Currently I am a Product Flow Specialist at Best Buy where I make use of my problem-solving skills in order to manage the inventory system, ensure product flow, and communicate/lead the product flow team to maintain efficient operations behind the scenes.<br><br>I am actively seeking opportunities to further develop my skills and contribute to innovative projects. I am passionate about growing in the software development field and eager to tackle new challenges that drive the tech industry forward.
